# twitterscripts
This is simply a script I am working on to mass migrate followed accounts from one account to another via the v2 Twitter API. It is not complete yet, but I will work on it when I find time.

I made this before Twitter was bought, but I am going to try to finish my code before the site burns to the ground.
